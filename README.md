# Moving-Averages
In this project, I have created a stock screener that analyses a listed company, calculates a 50-day simple moving average (SMA), and concludes whether the price is above or below that moving average. To start with this analysis, I have written a python program that imports stock market data using pandas and calculates a simple moving average.
